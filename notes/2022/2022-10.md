## Action Items (Benjie)

None are marked ready for review

## 1. Defer/Stream (Rob)

- The spec implementation has support for defer/stream in subscriptions, but Rob is proposing that support is dropped for defer/stream with subscriptions in the interest of keeping the spec moving at a good pace as there are still details around subscriptions which would benefit from workshopping 
- Ivan: Asks for clarification about the scope of the problems with subscriptions
- Rob has heard about feedback from multiple people around multiplexing, and there hasn't been enough discussion to make a decision
- Ivan: Do you feel like someone else should champion it?
- Rob: I don't think it make sense to work on subscriptions until the rest is done, but I'm okay to champion subscriptions as well
- Rob: I don't want the rest of defer/stream to be held up by the potentially cascading discussion around subscriptions
- Benjie: My main issue is the error throwing behavior. Would making the `if`s nullable again and removing the default allow the streaming behaviour?
- Rob: That would be a breaking change and potentially confusing 
- After further discussion, the following options were raised, see [Discussion #55](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/55):
-  - Option 1 - Disable via validation rule
-  - Option 2 - Disable via field error
-  - Option 3 - Move forward with defer/stream in subscriptions without multiplexing
-  - Option 4 - Move forward with defer/stream in subscriptions with multiplexing
- Ivan raised that clients can't reliably distinguish if `@defer` was inlined or not. See [Discussion 52](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/52)
- Rob highlighted the disucssion on `hasNext`, see [Discussion 57](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/57)
- Rob: We strongly suggest that servers which use `@defer/@stream` set `hasNext` to false if they are only sending one payload, that gives a more consistent shape to the responses. However, if a client is interacting with a server with the old Spec, and a server with the new Spec we have to make sure it isn't depending on something which isn't there. 
- Rob: oringinally it was the other way round, using `hasFinal`, which Facebook used. But there was the same problem of a client relying on `hasFinal` when it didn't exist in an old server. 
- General consensus is that we should require that `hasNext` be omitted on single responses. The referenced line in the spec is to be updated to "This entry must not be present for GraphQL operations that return a single response map."
