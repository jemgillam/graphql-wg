## Review agenda (2m, )

## Action Items

None are marked ready for review

## 1. Defer/Stream

 Next up to discuss is subscriptions with defer and stream
The spec implementation has support for defer/stream in subscriptions, but Rob is proposing that support is dropped for defer/stream with subscriptions
https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/55
Ivan: Asks for clarification about the scope of the problems with subscriptions
Rob has heard about feedback from multiple people around multiplexing, and there hasn't been enough discussion to make a decision
Ivan: Do you feel like someone else should champion it?
Rob: I don't think it make sense to work on subscriptions until the rest is done, but I'm okay to champion subscriptions as well
Rob: I don't want the rest of defer/stream to be held up by the potentially cascading discussion around subscriptions
Benjie: My main issue is the error throwing behavior
Discussion begins on the behavior of subscriptions
